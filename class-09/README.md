## Overview

Email account provisioning and client deployment are a routine operation in an internal service desk, but an important one. Following policy and SOP during employee onboarding, job transfer, and termination is critical to all parties involved.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class swe worked in the Registry and Event Viewer to get a hands-on feel of the core Windows configuration components

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be creating a reasonable and repeatable process for setting up workstations in a corporate environment.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on imaging, backups, and recovery methodologies.

## Workstation Deployment SOP

### Why
- An SOP ensures that all workstations are set up in a consistent and uniform manner. It defines a step-by-step process that needs to be followed every time a new workstation is deployed, minimizing variations and reducing the likelihood of errors.
- By having a well-defined SOP, the workstation deployment process becomes more efficient. IT teams can follow the documented procedures, saving time and effort, as they do not have to figure out the setup process from scratch each time.
- Standardizing workstation deployment ensures that all employees have access to the same software, configurations, security settings, and updates. This helps create a level playing field for all users, ensuring that everyone has the necessary tools and resources to perform their jobs effectively.
- A robust SOP addresses security concerns during workstation deployment. It outlines security measures, such as installing the latest patches, setting up firewall rules, and configuring antivirus software, to minimize potential vulnerabilities.
- In certain industries, there may be regulatory requirements or company policies related to workstation setup and data security. An SOP helps ensure that the organization stays compliant with these regulations and policies.
- With a well-documented SOP, IT teams can troubleshoot and resolve issues more efficiently during the deployment process. This minimizes downtime for the employees and allows them to start working on their tasks faster.
- When new IT team members join the organization, having a comprehensive SOP in place helps them quickly understand the procedures and best practices for workstation deployment. This facilitates smooth onboarding and knowledge transfer.
- As the organization grows and more workstations need to be deployed, having a reliable SOP becomes even more critical. It ensures that the deployment process remains scalable without compromising on quality or security.
- A well-defined SOP often includes backup and disaster recovery procedures. This helps in ensuring data integrity and business continuity in case of hardware failures, natural disasters, or other unexpected events.
- An SOP acts as a repository of knowledge for the organization's IT team. It captures the collective expertise and best practices, ensuring that critical knowledge is not lost if an IT staff member leaves the organization.

### What
- Workstation: A personal computer or terminal connected to a network, used by an individual for work or business purposes.
- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): A documented step-by-step process or set of guidelines that outlines the standard methods and best practices for performing a specific task or operation.
- Deployment: The process of installing, configuring, and setting up software, hardware, or systems for use in a specific environment or for a particular purpose.
- IT (Information Technology): The field of technology related to managing, processing, and transmitting information, often involving computers and computer networks.
- Configuration: The arrangement or setup of hardware and software components of a system, network, or application to work together optimally.
- Consistency: Ensuring uniformity and adherence to standards across various aspects of workstation setup and deployment.
- Efficiency: The ability to achieve a task or goal with minimal time and effort while maximizing resource utilization.
- Security: Measures taken to protect hardware, software, data, and systems from unauthorized access, damage, or misuse.
- Compliance: Adherence to legal, regulatory, and organizational policies and standards related to IT practices and data handling.
- Scalability: The ability of a system or process to handle increasing workloads and accommodate growth without significant degradation of performance.
- Disaster Recovery: Plans and procedures to restore and recover IT systems and data in the event of a major hardware failure, data loss, or disaster.
- Onboarding: The process of integrating and orienting new employees into the organization, including setting up their workstations and providing necessary training.
- Downtime: The period during which a system, network, or application is unavailable or not operational.
- Backup: A copy of data or files made to prevent data loss in case of hardware failure, accidental deletion, or other unexpected events.
- Firewall: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- Antivirus: Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (viruses, malware) from a computer system.
- Business Continuity: The ability of an organization to continue essential operations during and after a significant disruptive event.
- Knowledge Management: The process of capturing, organizing, and sharing knowledge within an organization to facilitate learning and decision-making.

### How
- Prepare a new VM for a company's new hire according to the company's requirements:
  - VM storage configuration
  - Windows user profile configuration
  - Second internal hard drive installed and accessible from a user's profile
  - Windows user management
    - Password-protected user profile
    - Password-protected administrator profile
  - Thunderbird client
  - Configure an automatic email signature for the new hire
  - RDP settings

<!-- ### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
  - Provide some ideas here for how the instructor can be interactive with the students
  - Can this be built using the Socratic method?
  - Can we use breakout or small group sessions -->
