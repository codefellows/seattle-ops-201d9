## Overview

Windows administrators should be aware of several key tools: Windows Firewall, Windows Defender Antivirus, and Task Manager.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In previous class, students performed Windows command line tools and how to interact with a Linux Samba share.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be exploring security features in Windows, specifically Defender and Firewall, as well as looking at task management and basic networking

**Where we're headed**:
Next class, we'll learn about OS upgrades and how to use Powershell to establish remote access to Windows.

## Windows Security Center

### Why
- This topic is important because it focuses on crucial elements of Windows security that protect the system from various threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. 
- What problems are we facing that this concept will solve:
  - Increased cyber threats
    - As technology advances, cyber threats become more sophisticated and prevalent, necessitating robust security measures.
  - Vulnerabilities in the system
    - Windows systems are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
  - Inadequate knowledge
    - Many users are unaware of the security features available in Windows, leading to potential risks due to misconfigurations or lack of proper usage.

### What
- _______ is a centralized dashboard in Windows operating systems that provides information and controls for various security features and settings.
- _______ is a built-in Windows utility that allows users to monitor and manage running processes, system performance, and resource usage.
- _______ is an integrated antivirus solution in Windows that provides real-time protection against malware, viruses, spyware, and other threats.
- _______ is a security feature in Windows that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect the system from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

### How
- Learn how to use Task Manager to identify and manage processes, monitor system performance, and handle resource utilization issues.
- Explore the functionalities of Windows Defender Antivirus and how it detects, blocks, and removes malware and other threats.
- Understand how to configure and manage Windows Firewall to control network traffic and protect the system from external threats.

<!-- ### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
  - Provide some ideas here for how the instructor can be interactive with the students
  - Can this be built using the Socratic method?
  - Can we use breakout or small group sessions -->
