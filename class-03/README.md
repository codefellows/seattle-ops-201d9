## Overview

Issue tracking systems are a useful way to manage and resolve a technical workload as part of routine service desk operations. This exercise will expose you to common Windows problems and challenge you to document the problems in the Spiceworks ticketing system.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we practiced using Git, GitHub, and VS Code to complete the first Ops Challenge.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be using issue tracking systems to manage and resolve a technical workload as part of routine service desk operations.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will introduce troubleshooting methodologies to help resolve problems in a systemic, strategic fashion as part of operations support efforts.

## Issue Tracking System

### Why
- Issue tracking systems provide a centralized platform to log, track, and manage all kinds of issues, whether they are related to IT support requests, software bugs, system errors, or project tasks. This centralized approach ensures that all issues are documented and accessible in one place, making it easier for IT professionals to stay organized and prioritize their work.
- Issue tracking systems facilitate efficient communication and collaboration among team members, support agents, and stakeholders. Instead of relying on scattered emails or informal messages, everyone involved can access the system to view updates, comments, and progress on specific issues. This streamlines communication and reduces the risk of important information being missed or overlooked.
- By using an issue tracking system, IT teams can assign priorities to different issues based on their urgency and impact on business operations. This helps teams focus on resolving critical issues first and ensures that resources are allocated appropriately to address the most pressing problems.
- Issue tracking systems promote transparency in issue resolution. Every action taken, updates made, and comments left on an issue are recorded, providing a clear audit trail of the entire process. This level of transparency enhances accountability, as it allows team members to track who is responsible for each issue and monitor progress.
- Issue tracking systems often include features for generating reports and analyzing trends. By monitoring patterns of recurring issues or identifying bottlenecks in the support process, IT teams can proactively address systemic problems and implement preventive measures to avoid future issues.
- For IT support teams, using an issue tracking system can significantly improve customer satisfaction. The system helps ensure that customer requests are not lost or overlooked, as each support ticket is captured and tracked until resolution. This results in faster response times and better overall support experience for users and customers.
- Beyond IT support, issue tracking systems are also valuable for project management. They help teams manage tasks, milestones, and project-related issues effectively. Project managers can allocate resources, monitor progress, and track project performance using these systems, leading to more successful project outcomes.

### How
- In a theoretical scenario, you will help Bob resolve the technical issues on his Windows 10 PC.
  - Repair the computer so that Bob can open an important report from his user profile on his desktop with Apache OpenOffice suite.
  - Create a shortcut to the Apache Word Processor on Bob's desktop.
  - Notify Bob of any changes made via Spiceworks.
- Complete a Spiceworks ticket from inception to resolution.
